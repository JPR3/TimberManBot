# TimberManBot
This program was designed to automatically play [this version](https://fertiz.itch.io/timberman) of the popular game Timberman. The game is a reaction-based game, where players must see if a branch is coming down on the right or left side of a tree and move their lumberjack to the other side. Despite playing extremely quickly, the bot eventually loses as the game gets continuously harder as the score increases.

## Usage
To use the program, simply run it and open Timberman in any browser. After pressing the play button, press space to start the program and watch as the lumberjack begins chopping at superhuman speeds!

To stop the program, move the mouse to any corner of the screen.
